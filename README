POE-Filter-Transparent-SMTP

The filter aims to make SMTP data transparent just before going onto
the wire as per RFC 821 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Section
4.5.2. TRANSPARENCY. See L<http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc821.html> for
details.

Conversely the filter takes transparent data from the wire and
converts it to the original format.

The main purpose of this filter is to help
L<POE::Component::Client::SMTP> create transparent messages when
comunicating with an SMTP server. However the filter can be used by
any Perl SMTP client or server.

Internally it uses L<POE::Filter::Line> in order to split messages
into lines. Also as stated in the RFC every line it puts on the wire
is ended by <CRLF>.

When receiving data from the wire (as it is the case for an SMTP
server), lines should be separated with <CRLF> as the RFC
specifies. However this is not always true as some SMTP clients are
broken. So if you are using the filter on the receiving end maybe you
would like to specify a regular expression that is more flexible for
the line terminator.
